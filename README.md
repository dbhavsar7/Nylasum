This project involves a tool with Nylas using Artificial Intelligence where an email can be summarized with the character limit 
of a tweet, allowing one to tweet email summaries with a twitter developer account
=======
The primary objective of this project is to create an extension to a standard email interface (ex: Gmail, Outlook, etc.) 
which can summarize the email contents using LLaMa 2

How to Run Project:
1. Open the notebook in Colab (either through the provided file on this repository or linked [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wDfueNLpTSybKaHytgBx9R7A4MYOL6at?usp=sharing) - if using the link, make a copy of the notebook for your own instance)
2. Modify the cell under Nylasum > Credentials to use your own details for the respective services/APIs
3. Run all the cells - the last one will provide a text-based user interface to interact
